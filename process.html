				<h2>The Lemon Law Process</h2>
				<h3>The process of finding out if your vehicle is a lemon can be confusing and convoluted.</h3>
				<p>There is a set of rules you must follow, hoops you must jump through, and paperwork you must file. I have written out the basic steps below so that you can get a high-level view of the end-to-end flow.</p>
				<h3>How do I know if <strong>my</strong> Jeep Wrangler is a lemon?</h3>
				<p>Here are the criteria that must be met:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The vehicle has a factory hard or soft top installed.</li>
					<li>You notice water inside the vehicle after it has been sitting out in the rain, and it happens every time.</li>
					<li>You have taken it to a Chrysler-authorized service dealership at least <strong>four</strong> times to have the problem fixed.</li>
					<li>The dealership admits <strong>in writing</strong> that they cannot fix the problem.</li>
				</ol>
