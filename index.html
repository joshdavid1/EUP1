				<h2>Do not ignore the water!</h2>
				<h3>Your new car should not leak.</h3>
				<p>Jeep Wranglers are known for leaking water into the interior. Many owners take this as fact and simply move on with their lives; they deal with the annoyance of water on the floor or they try to fix it themselves. If you have a Wrangler that leaks and is under the manufacturer's warranty, you do <strong>not</strong> have to just accept this design flaw. There are resources available to you that allow you to force Chrysler to take care of the issue.</p>
				<h3>There are resources available to you!</h3>
